        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p class="lead">
		Vision
We foresee a future where users are connected in a way never before accomplished.  From the innermost friend group all the way to the national level, users will be able to intertwine their interests and content so fluidly that it will seemingly be reality.  Users will continue their proven social media interaction by posting content for their friends to see.  Friends will determine if the content is popular enough to reach the school level, and the school will determine if the content is popular enough to reach the national viewership.  This path to the top creates the opportunity for posts, deemed most popular by the viewers, to reach the eyes, ears, brains, and hearts of every single CollegeLife user.  Instantly, the collegiate population will become enlightened, aware, and influenced by the content deemed most important by the people in their generation and direct environment.  National content has never been streamlined to this extent before, and the awareness that is facilitated by this streamlined content will create a single, unified voice for an entire demographic.
<br>
<br>
CollegeLife will not only be a social media platform.  CollegeLife will be a company that strives to give back to not only the universities that allow the college lifestyle to take place, but the surrounding communities who coexist with the collegiate population on a daily basis.  We envision a platform that, as said previously, not only recreates the televised news, but allows for viewers to interact and determine that national news as well. 
<br>
<br>
Our main goal is to create an application in which the collegiate population feels it is necessary to use the platform to connect with their generation and allow every user to have a voice that will be heard.  CollegeLife will create strong roots within the social media industry, and we will expand with our users.  When our initial userbase graduates from college and CollegeLife, we believe we will be able to retain our users and graduate them to our "Life" platform, which will encompass professional fields and life beyond college. 
<br>
<br>
CollegeLife will become a staple in the social media industry and encompass many facets of life- recreating reality as we perceive it onto the ever-increasingly popular social media technology.

      <div class="starter-template">
        <h1>The App</h1>
        <p class="lead">CollegeLife will be a primarily picture-centered platform like Instagram, but we believe anything and everything should be posted to effectively replicate the existing collegiate culture.  Users will receive gratification from all of the posts they produce.  Users will be inclined to interact on the platform by liking other user's posts, gathering likes on their own posts, and competing against other users and schools for top rankings throughout the collegiate culture.  As stated previously, our platform will utilize a streamlined acquisition process, which will create an environment where posts that are already popular among friend groups will be displayed to schools and then possibly the nation.  Simply speaking, before the school or nation is exposed to posts, the post will have already passed the "first round of interviews."  This is the first platform that publicizes previously determined popular posts to the public, which opens the door for the nation to see the best posts when they are happening, and allows for normal posts to be viewed by friends- which is what the already existing social platforms accomplish.
		<br>
		<br>
		Overall, we believe that CollegeLife has factors that coincide with the proven social media concepts that are present in today's society. However, we believe we have captured emerging trends within the usage of social media by the collegiate population, and have joined these emerging trends into a platform that will unite the collegiate culture.
